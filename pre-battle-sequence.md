# Pre-Battle Sequence

Follow these steps in order before a battle commences

1. [Determine Scenario](#determine-scenario), using the necromunda rule book and the [Scenario Adjustments](#scenario-adjustments) making sure both players understand the rules and adjustments.
1. [Determine Tactics & inducements](#determine-inducements--tactics)
1. [Determine Sub-Plots](#determine-sub-plots)
1. Battle!

-----------------

## Determine Scenario
To determine which scenario will be used, the attacker rolls 2D6 on the following table:

| 2D6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 2-3 | The player with the greater number of Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, both players should roll a D6, with the player who rolls the highest choosing. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, see page 91. |
| 4 | Play Scenario 6, [Smash & Grab](#zone-mortalis-6-smash--grab), or [Escape The Pit](#other-escape-the-pit)|
| 5 | Play Scenario 4, [Border Dispute](#sector-mechanicus-4-border-dispute) or [The Marauders](#zone-mortalis-4-the-marauders) |
| 6-7 | Play [Scenario 1](#sector-mechanicus-1-stand-off--zone-mortalis-1-tunnel-skirmish), Stand off or Tunnel Skirmish. |
| 8 | Play Scenario 2, [Looters](#sector-mechanicus-2-looters) or [The Trap](#zone-mortalis-2-the-trap). |
| 9 | Play Scenario 3, [Ambush](#sector-mechanicus-3-ambush) or [Forgotten Riches](#zone-mortalis-3-forgotten-riches) |
| 10 | Play Scenario 5, [Sabotage](#sector-mechanicus-5-sabotage) or [Sneak Attack](#zone-mortalis-5-sneak-attack) |
| 11-12 | The player with fewer Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, see page 91. |

Players should now agree whether they will fight using the Zone Mortalis or Sector Mechanicus terrain. If they cannot decide, the player who chooses the scenario decides. If neither player chooses the scenario (for example, because a 4-9 was rolled on the table), the players should roll off and the winner’s choice applies.

When determining the scenario to be played, the attacker rolls on the Determine Scenario table as normal. If the gang’s Gang Ratings differ by 100 credits or more, the gang with the lower Gang Rating  may add or subtract 1 from the result to determine the scenario.

If the result allows a mission to be chosen, the chosen mission must be one of the standard Dominion Campaign missions or a house specific mission available to your house. However, you can only choose a house mission once in each half of the campaign.

-----------------

## Determine Inducements & Tactics

First draw tactics cards as the scenario dictates, with the following adjustments:

### Tactics Adjustments

#### Additional Fighters 
Gang Tactics that add additional fighters to your starting crew are subject to the Missions - Crew Sizes house rule. In addition, you cannot replace a gang member in your starting crew with an additional fighter from a Gang Tactic, you can only fill empty spaces in your starting crew.

#### Deck Building 
Build your Gang Tactics deck at the start of each game by selecting 12 Gang Tactics cards from your gang’s respective House book (all other Gang Tactics cards are banned). You do not draw additional Gang Tactics if the total credits value of one player’s starting crew is less than their opponent’s, instead see Missions - Inducements.

#### Choose 
When a mission says that you may choose a Gang Tactic, instead draw 3 random cards from your deck and choose one of them to add to your hand.

#### Random 
When a mission says that you may draw a random Gang Tactic, simply draw a random card from your deck and add it to your hand.

### Inducements

Inducements are benefits to give the underdog a leg up in the battle. If the credit values of the starting crews differ by 100 credits or more, the gang with the lower credit value gains access to inducements for that game. A player with access to inducements may select any number of inducements, following each inducement’s limitations, up to a total cost equal to the difference in the credit value of the starting crews. Inducements are selected after drawing Gang Tactics but before deployment. Any terrain granted by inducements are deployed after deployment zones are determined but before any fighters are deployed. The list of inducements can be found on the inducements tab of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXovwud7bZbDQ3QfwzuPsN9wDsdv37bkEkIIVwmg3yw/edit?usp=sharing).

-----------------

## Determine Sub-Plots

Instead of the usual rules for subplots, use the following:

A sub-plot is a side mission that a gang can complete to earn additional rewards. After Crews, Gang Tactics and Inducements have been resolved, but before Deployment, each player draws one card from a regular deck of playing cards (including Jokers) to determine their sub-plot. Do not show this card to your opponent! Sub-plots are secret, and should not be revealed until the sub-plot tells you to do so or you complete it. The value of the card determines what task you have been assigned to complete the sub-plot. The suit of the card determines what reward you will get if you complete the sub-plot. The sub-plot tasks and rewards can be found on the relevant tabs of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXovwud7bZbDQ3QfwzuPsN9wDsdv37bkEkIIVwmg3yw/edit?usp=sharing). Most of the time, each player will only have one sub-plot, however it is possible to have more than one.

If your gang has a lower Gang Rating than your opponent’s gang, you can ignore the suit of one of your sub-plots and choose which suit to count it as instead. Whether they have been completed or not, sub-plots are discarded after the battle.

Whenever you complete a sub-plot during a battle, you may immediately draw one random Gang Tactic from your Gang Tactics deck and add it to your hand, unless there are no cards left to draw. If you draw a Gang Tactic that must be used at the start of the battle or before (such as during deployment), you may discard it and draw another one.

-----------------

## SCENARIO ADJUSTMENTS

The objective of these scenario adjustments is to make battles fairer, and to avoid draws in situations where cowardly tactics would otherwise be advantageous.

For each scenario listed below, only changes are listed here. You should use the Necromunda rule book for the full scenario details.

Both players should agree on the scenario rules before the match, but if no agreement can be reached then they must use the adjusted scenario detailed here.

### Global Adjustments

#### Crew Size

All missions have a maximum starting crew size of 8, and a mission’s crew size limit cannot be exceeded by any means, regardless of rules that say otherwise. The only exceptions being exotic beasts and the Cawdor Bonepicker’s ability: Devout Masses (Juve).

#### Reinforcements

If a mission would have more than D3 Reinforcements arrive, only D3 arrive instead.

#### Rewards (Credits)

 If a mission rewards credits for winning or losing, it rewards 2D6x10 credits for winning and 1D6x10 credits otherwise. If a mission rewards credits for objectives (such as loot caches), the reward can only be earned up to 3 times (eg. up to 3 loot caches), and each objective can reward no more than 1D6x10 credits. If a mission rewards no credits, it rewards 1D6x10 credits instead.

### Sector Mechanicus 1: Stand-Off // Zone Mortalis 1: Tunnel Skirmish 

Pages 124 & 125

**Dice Roll: 6 or 7**

Two gangs meet in neutral territory and a firefight ensues // The stakes are high when two gangs face-off in unclaimed turf, fighting for control of the surrounding area

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately. 

In addition, at the end of round 7 if the battle would not end in a draw, the battle ends immediately. If the battle would end in a draw, play one more round and the battle ends at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: If one gang has scored more points than the other at the end of the battle, they are victorious. If both gangs have scored the same number of points, the battle ends in a draw.

-----------------

### Sector Mechanicus 2: Looters 

**Dice Roll: 8**

Pages 126 & 127

A gang launches an all-out attack on a rival’s turf in the hope of raiding their stash.

**Notes**: This mission is heavily tipped towards the defender when considering the turn limit. The attacker will be forced to rush forwards into gunfire to have a chance at winning.

Because of this, the burden of the attacker has been lowered, and on turn 8 they may have a slight chance to confirm the win if they are close.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

In addition, at the end of round 7 if the attacker has claimed two caskets; or if the attacker has not claimed two caskets but has bottled, the battle ends immediately. If the attacker has not claimed two caskets and has not bottled, play one more round and the battle ends immediately at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, they have claimed more loot caskets than are left on the battlefield. Otherwise, the defender wins.

**Updated**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, they have claimed **TWO** loot caskets. Otherwise, the defender wins.

-----------------

### Sector Mechanicus 3: Ambush 

**Dice Roll: 9**

Pages 128 & 129

A gang sets a trap for their rivals, hoping to catch them unawares...

**Notes**: There are two points that need addressing for this scenario:
1. If the defender voluntarily bottles on round one, it seems they win by default.
2. The time limit makes the attackers job harder

On addressing **1**, if the defender voluntarily bottles they lose the game. Bottling under normal circumstances is still probably good for them but they cannot force it.

On addressing **2**, we just make the win condition slightly easier for the attacker. Taking exactly half OOA is good enough.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

In addition, at the end of round 7 if the battle would not end in a draw, the battle ends immediately. If the battle would end in a draw, play one more round and the battle ends at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, more defenders were taken Out of Action than escaped – defenders that fled the battlefield do not count. Otherwise, the defender wins.

**Updated**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, half (or more) of the defenders were taken Out of Action, or the defender voluntarily bottles. Otherwise, the defender wins.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately. 

In addition, at the end of round 7 if at least one relic has been defiled, the battle ends immediately. Otherwise play one more round and the battle ends at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: If one gang has any fighters on the battlefield – not including Seriously Injured fighters – at the end of the battle, and their gang relic has not been defiled, they are victorious. If both gangs’ relics have been defiled, the battle ends in a draw.

**Updated**: At the end of the battle:

- If only one relic is defiled, and the gang with the non-defiled relic has any fighters on the battlefield – not including Seriously Injured fighters – at the end of the battle, that gang is declared the victor.
- If no relic has been defiled, but one gang has bottled and the other has not, the gang that has not bottled is declared the victor.
- If neither gang is declared the victor, the battle ends in a draw.
