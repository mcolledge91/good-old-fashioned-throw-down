# DETERMINE SCENARIO
To determine which scenario will be used, roll 2D6 on the following table:

| 2D6 | Result |
| 2-3 | The player with the greater number of Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, both players should roll a D6, with the player who rolls the highest choosing. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, see page 91. |
| 4-5 | Play the Border Dispute or the Marauders scenario. |
| 6-7 | Play the Stand-off or the Tunnel Skirmish scenario. |
| 8-9 | Play the Sabotage or the Sneak Attack scenario. |
| 10-12 | The player with fewer Territories chooses which scenario to play. If both players have the same number of Territories, the winner of a roll-off chooses which scenario to play. If the scenario dictates there is an attacker and a defender, see page 91. |

Players should now agree whether they will fight using the Zone Mortalis or Sector Mechanicus terrain. If they cannot decide, the player who chooses the scenario decides. If neither player chooses the scenario (for example, because a 4-9 was rolled on the table), the players should roll off and the winner’s choice applies.

## HOUSE RULE
When determining the scenario to be played, the attacker rolls on the Determine Scenario table as normal. If the gang’s Gang Ratings differ by 100 credits or more, the gang with the lower Gang Rating  may add or subtract 1 from the result to determine the scenario.

If the result allows a mission to be chosen, the chosen mission must be one of the standard Dominion Campaign missions or a house specific mission available to your house. However, you can only choose a house mission once in each half of the campaign.

-----------------

## SNEAK ATTACK

Due to the fact that missions now have a turn limit, sneak attacks have some potential problems that would not have previously existed. We add the following rules to address the problem:

### Round Zero

On missions that use the sneak attack rules, we introduce an additional round zero at the beginning of the game. This works the same as any other game round.

### Raising The Alarm

Replace the following rule:

**Classic**: From the fifth round onwards, if the attacker rolls a 1 or 2 for their Priority roll, the alarm is raised.

**Updated**: When rolling Priority, if the attacker rolls lower than the current round, the alarm is raised. 

e.g. On round 2, if the attacker rolls a 1, the alarm is raised. On round 4, if the attacker rolls a 1, 2, or 3, the alarm is raised.

## SCENARIO ADJUSTMENTS

The objective of these scenario adjustments is to make battles fairer, and to avoid draws in situations where cowardly tactics would otherwise be advantageous.

For each scenario listed below, only changes are listed here. You should use the Necromunda rule book for the full scenario details.

Both players should agree on the scenario rules before the match, but if no agreement can be reached then they must use the adjusted scenario detailed here.

### Sector Mechanicus 1: Stand-Off // Zone Mortalis 1: Tunnel Skirmish 

Pages 124 & 125

**Dice Roll: 6 or 7**

Two gangs meet in neutral territory and a firefight ensues // The stakes are high when two gangs face-off in unclaimed turf, fighting for control of the surrounding area

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately. 

In addition, at the end of round 7 if the battle would not end in a draw, the battle ends immediately. If the battle would end in a draw, play one more round and the battle ends at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: If one gang has scored more points than the other at the end of the battle, they are victorious. If both gangs have scored the same number of points, the battle ends in a draw.

-----------------

### Sector Mechanicus 2: Looters 

Pages 126 & 127

A gang launches an all-out attack on a rival’s turf in the hope of raiding their stash.

**Notes**: This mission is heavily tipped towards the defender when considering the turn limit. The attacker will be forced to rush forwards into gunfire to have a chance at winning.

Because of this, the burden of the attacker has been lowered, and on turn 8 they may have a slight chance to confirm the win if they are close.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

In addition, at the end of round 7 if the attacker has claimed two caskets; or if the attacker has not claimed two caskets but has bottled, the battle ends immediately. If the attacker has not claimed two caskets and has not bottled, play one more round and the battle ends immediately at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, they have claimed more loot caskets than are left on the battlefield. Otherwise, the defender wins.

**Updated**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, they have claimed **TWO** loot caskets. Otherwise, the defender wins.

-----------------

### Sector Mechanicus 3: Ambush 

Pages 128 & 129

A gang sets a trap for their rivals, hoping to catch them unawares...

**Notes**: There are two points that need addressing for this scenario:
1. If the defender voluntarily bottles on round one, it seems they win by default.
2. The time limit makes the attackers job harder

On addressing **1**, if the defender voluntarily bottles they lose the game. Bottling under normal circumstances is still probably good for them but they cannot force it.

On addressing **2**, we just make the win condition slightly easier for the attacker. Taking exactly half OOA is good enough.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

### Victory

**Classic**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, more defenders were taken Out of Action than escaped – defenders that fled the battlefield do not count. Otherwise, the defender wins.

**Updated**: The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, half (or more) of the defenders were taken Out of Action, or the defender voluntarily bottles. Otherwise, the defender wins.

-----------------

### Sector Mechanicus 4: Border Dispute

Pages 130 & 131

**Dice Roll: 4 or 5**

**Notes**: There are two points that need addressing for this scenario:
1. Getting all the way accross to the relic and defiling it may take many turns (of running into gunfire).
2. Implementing the turn limit makes a draw more likely.

On addressing **1**, The relics deploy more centrally, incresing likelihood that either relic is defiled.

On addressing **2**, There may be an 8th round, encouraging a team to try and defile by round 7. Ultimately if nethier team is able to defile, they may still have a chance to win based on forcing the enemy team to bottle.

### Deployment (Relic)

**Classic**: Finally, each player places a gang relic in their own turf. This can either be a generic token or a small terrain feature. The gang relic must be set up at least 5" away from any edge of the battlefield.

**Updated**: Finally, each player places a gang relic in their own turf. This can either be a generic token or a small terrain feature. The gang relic must be set up wholly within 12" of the line that divides the battlefield.

### Ending the battle

**Classic**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately.

**Updated**: If either gang has no fighters left on the battlefield at the end of any round, the battle ends immediately. 

In addition, at the end of round 7 if at least one relic has been defiled, the battle ends immediately. Otherwise play one more round and the battle ends at the end of round 8.

### Victory

**Classic**: If one gang has any fighters on the battlefield – not including Seriously Injured fighters – at the end of the battle, and their gang relic has not been defiled, they are victorious. If both gangs’ relics have been defiled, the battle ends in a draw.

**Updated**: At the end of the battle:

- If only one relic is defiled, and the gang with the non-defiled relic has any fighters on the battlefield – not including Seriously Injured fighters – at the end of the battle, that gang is declared the victor.
- If no relic has been defiled, but one gang has bottled and the other has not, the gang that has not bottled is declared the victor.
- If neither gang is declared the victor, the battle ends in a draw.

**Updated**: At the end of the battle, any Captives that were freed and have taken flight, or who were freed and would start the next round Standing and Active, are considered to have Escaped.

The attacker wins if, at the end of the battle, all of their fighters held Captive are considered to have Escaped.

The defender wins if, at the end of the battle, none of the fighters held captive are considered to have Escaped.

Otherwise the game is a draw.

### Deployment

**Classic**: The defender sets up their sentries anywhere on the battlefield, and a gang relic anywhere within 6" of one edge of the battlefield. The attacker then sets up each of their fighters entirely within 4" of any edge of the battlefield and must be within 4" of another member of the crew. The attacker is free to use all edges.
